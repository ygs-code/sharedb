# The OT Fuzzer

This directory contains The Fuzzer (Bug finding hound, destroyer of confidence).

If you make an OT type and you haven't run the fuzzer on your type, you will
almost certainly find bugs with your implementation. It is obnoxious the number
of bugs this little bundle of joy has found over the years.

Use it like this:

```javascript
var fuzzer = require('ot-fuzzer');
var mytype = require('./mytype');

var generateRandomOp = function(snapshot) {
  // ...
  return [op, newSnapshot];
};

fuzzer(mytype, generateRandomOp);
```

---

## API

You need to write a random op generator function for your type:

**generateRandomOp(snapshot) -> [op, newSnapshot]**: generateRandomOp
generates a random operation that is valid for the given snapshot. It returns
the operation along with the expected result of applying the operation. You
*should not* use `type.apply` to generate the expected snapshot - that would
make it very hard to find bugs in the apply function itself.

The fuzzer will start with an empty document (`type.create()`) and then
iteratively generate operations with generateRandomOp and apply them. If your
generateRandomOp function only makes operations which increase the size of the
document, the randomizer will eat all your RAM and get really slow. You should
strike a balance in your generateRandomOp function between growing and
shrinking the document.

Arguably this is a bug in the fuzzer - feel free to submit a pull request.

Once you've written generateRandomOp, you can run the fuzzer:

**fuzzer(type, generateRandomOp, [iterations])**: Runs the fuzzer. The
randomizer generates a few new operations from the initial document snapshot
and tests that the various OT functions do what they're supposed to.

If unspecified, the fuzzer defaults to 2000 iterations. When debugging your OT
type, you should increase this so you can run the fuzzer overnight.

### Random data functions

The fuzzer library also comes with a mersenne prime random number generator and
some helper functions. These functions make the fuzzer *repeatable*, so each
identical instantiation of the fuzzer will trigger the same bugs. This is
extremely convenient when you're debugging your library, and as such its highly
recommended that you use these functions instead of `Math.random()`.

The seed changes every 6 hours. If you want to do more testing, don't change
the seed - instead increase the iteration count or add more cases to your
generator.

- **randomReal()**: Generate a random float less than 1. This function is a
direct replacement for Math.random(), except it uses a seed.
- **randomInt(n)**: Generate a random int in the range [0,n). (Ie, a non-negative
integer less than n).
- **randomWord()**: Select and return a random word. The word is chosen from the
jabberwocky.

These functions are exposed on the fuzzer function. Eg:

```javascript
var fuzzer = require('ot-fuzzer');

console.log("I have " + fuzzer.randomInt(100) + " " + fuzzer.randomWord() + " in my basket");
// -> I have 69 mimsy in my basket
```

## Commentary

This library is several years old now. I (Joseph) wrote it when I first started
writing the original prototype of ShareJS. It then lived for awhile in the
share/ottypes library, and its now been separated out.

The randomizer has also helped debug my C implementation of the text type. I
wired the randomizer to output what it was testing into a few hundred megs of
JSON files, and then read the data back in from my C program. It worked great.

The code is in coffeescript for purely historical reasons. I'd love to move it
to javascript - I'm just strapped for time. I'd welcome a pull request if
anyone is keen to help. (Please start with the coffeescript compiled output if
so).

There's also no unit tests - and there really should be. This code is
routinely tested by actually running it against things. But it could use some
simple tests of its own to make sure it actually catches obvious bugs in a
dummy OT type.
